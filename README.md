# Hospital-Management
Project Description – Hospital Management System in C

The Hospital Management System is a C-based console application designed to simplify and organize hospital operations. It allows users to add, store, search, and view patient records, along with optional modules like doctor information and appointment scheduling. The system demonstrates core programming concepts such as structures, arrays, file handling, functions, and menu-driven programs. This project helps simulate a real-world hospital environment where patient data must be managed efficiently and securely.

Project Objectives

To design a simple hospital database using C.

To store and manage patient information.

To allow users to add, view, search, and delete patient records.

To demonstrate structured programming using functions and structures.

To implement persistent storage using file handling (optional).

Features Included

System Requirements

Programming Language: C

Compiler: GCC / Turbo C / Clang

Platform: Windows, Linux, or macOS

Text Editor: CodeBlocks, VS Code, Dev-C++, Turbo C, etc.

Instructions to Run the Project
1. Save the Program

Save the .c file with a proper name:

hospital_management.c

2. Compile the Program

Using GCC:

gcc hospital_management.c -o hospital

3. Run the Program
./hospital


or on Windows:

hospital.exe

4. Use Menu Options

Once the program runs, you will see a menu like:

1. Add Patient  
2. View Patients  
3. Search Patient
